# 🚀 Project Setup & Development Guide

Welcome to this project!  
This guide will help you quickly get started with setting up the **backend (Django)** and **frontend (Next.js or other)** using handy `.bat` scripts.

✅ **You can now copy this and save it as `README.md` in your project root.**
If you’d like, I can also add badges (Python, Django, Next.js, License, etc.) or a Table of Contents at the top. Just tell me! 🚀
